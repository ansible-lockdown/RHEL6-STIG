RHEL 6 DISA STIG
================

Configure RHEL 6 machine to be DISA STIG compliant. CAT I findings will be corrected by default. CAT II and CAT III findings can be corrected by setting the appropriate variable to enable those playbooks.

This role **will make changes to the system** that could break things. This is not an auditing tool but rather a remediation tool to be used after an audit has been conducted.

The role tries to be helpful and pause to let you know it found something. You can disable this behaviour if you want to run it unattended by setting `rhel6stig_fullauto` to `true`.

## IMPORTANT INSTALL STEP

If you want to install this via the `ansible-galaxy` command you'll need to run it like this:

`ansible-galaxy install -p roles nousdefions.STIG-RHEL6,devel`

Example Playbook
-------------------------

Make sure to include the vars_prompt section in your playbook. It is needed for the tasks that set the grub password.

    - hosts: servers
      sudo: yes

      roles:
         - { role: RHEL6-STIG, rhel6stig_cat1: true, rhel6stig_cat2: true, rhel6stig_cat3: false }


Tags
----
Many tags are available for precise control of what is and is not changed. When running this playbook with tags, always include the `prelim_tasks` tag. This will run all the setup tasks that gather information and set variables used by subsequest tasks. If run without `prelim_tasks`, certain tasks may fail.

Some examples of using tags:

    # Only remediate ssh
    ansible-playbook site.yml --tags="prelim_tasks,ssh"

    # Don't change SNMP or postfix
    ansible-playbook site.yml --skip-tags="postfix,mail,snmp"
