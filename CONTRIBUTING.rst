Contributing to MindPoint Group Projects
========================================

Signing your contribution
-------------------------

We've chosen to use the Developer's Certificate of Origin (DCO) method
that is employed by the Linux Kernel Project, which provides a simple
way to contribute to MindPoint Group projects.

The process is to certify the below DCO 1.1 text
::

    Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

    By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

    (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
        have the right to submit it under the open source license
        indicated in the file; or

    (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
        of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
        license and I have the right under that license to submit that
        work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
        by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
        permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
        in the file; or

    (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
        person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
        it.

    (d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
        are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
        personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
        maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
        this project or the open source license(s) involved.

Then, when it comes time to submit a contribution, include the
following text in your contribution commit message:

::

   Signed-off-by: Joan Doe <joan.doe@email.com>

::


This message can be entered manually, or if you have configured git
with the correct `user.name` and `user.email`, you can use the `-s`
option to `git commit` to automatically include the signoff message.
